Petrus Connect
Petrus Connect is a monitoring system created with the aim to oversee CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. It's available in two versions: Petrus Connect 1.0 and Petrus Connect 2.0. The system was initiated 1.5 years ago.

Purpose
•	Data Collection: It's utilized to gather data from machines using PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers). This data includes machine statuses like idle, running, or under maintenance, which are then displayed on a dashboard.
•	Reports: Enables the creation of various reports based on the collected data.

Evaluation Metrics
•	Performance Measurement: Uses evaluation metrics to calculate the performance of machines.
•	O.E.E (Overall Equipment Effectiveness): This is a key parameter used to measure machine performance, calculated based on three metrics: Availability, Performance, and Quality.

O.E.E Calculation
•	Availability: Calculated as the ratio of machine runtime to planned production time.
•	Performance: Measures the actual production against the target.
•	Quality: Assesses the ratio of good products to total products produced.

Industrial 4.0 Integration
•	Purpose: Aims to increase efficiency, productivity, and decrease product rejection.
•	Petrus Connect 1.0: Initially used the PMS (Production Monitoring System) model to replace traditional pen-paper methods for more accurate O.E.E measurements.
•	Petrus Connect 2.0: Utilizes four models - PMS, CMS, QMS, MMS, and HMI for more comprehensive monitoring and management.

Petrus Connect 2.0 Models
•	PMS: Production Monitoring System.
•	CMS: Condition-Based Monitoring System.
•	QMS: Quality Monitoring System.
•	MMS: Maintenance Management System.
•	HMI: Human-Machine Interface.
This overview highlights how Petrus Connect evolved from its initial version to a more comprehensive system, integrating various models to enhance monitoring, maintenance, quality control, and human-machine interaction for efficient CNC machine management.

Scenario:
•	Shift Hours: 8 hours
•	Planned Production Time: 8 hours (no downtime planned)
•	Actual Machine Runtime: 7 hours (1 hour downtime due to maintenance)
•	Target Production: 100 parts
•	Actual Parts Produced: 80 parts
•	Good Quality Parts: 70 parts out of 80 produced

Calculation:
1.	Availability: Availability = Actual Runtime / Planned Production Time Availability = 7 / 8 = 0.875 (or 87.5%)
2.	Performance: Performance = Actual Parts Produced / Target Production Performance = 80 / 100 = 0.8 (or 80%)
3.	Quality: Quality = Good Quality Parts / Total Parts Produced Quality = 70 / 80 = 0.875 (or 87.5%)
4.	O.E.E: O.E.E = Availability × Performance × Quality O.E.E = 0.875 (Availability) × 0.8 (Performance) × 0.875 (Quality) = 0.61 (or 61%)

Interpretation:
In this scenario, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (O.E.E) of the CNC machine is 61%. This means that the machine, during the shift, operated at 61% of its maximum potential efficiency, considering factors like availability, performance, and quality.
This O.E.E value helps identify areas for improvement. For instance, despite good quality output, downtime (availability) and production rate (performance) could be targeted for improvement to enhance overall efficiency.
