Amazon EC2:

1. Virtual Computing Environment:
    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    It allows users to rent virtual servers (known as instances) and run applications on them.

2. Flexibility and Scalability:
    EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized for various use cases.
    Users can scale computing resources up or down based on demand.

3. Pricing Model:
    Users pay for what they use (pay-as-you-go) based on instance type, usage hours, and data transfer.
    Reserved Instances and Spot Instances offer pricing models for long-term and cost-effective use.

4. Instance Types:
    EC2 offers various instance families (e.g., general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized) catering to different workload requirements.

5. Operating Systems and Customization:
    - Supports various operating systems (Linux, Windows) and allows customization of configurations, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking.

Key Concepts:

1. Instances:
    - Virtual servers in the cloud that run applications and host data.
    - Users can launch, manage, and terminate instances based on their requirements.

2. AMI (Amazon Machine Image):
    - A template that contains the software configuration (OS, application server, applications) required to launch an instance.

3. Security Groups:
    - Acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic for instances.
    - Users define rules to allow or deny specific traffic types and sources.

4. EBS (Elastic Block Store):
    - Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
    - Offers persistent and highly available storage volumes that can be attached/detached from instances.

5. Key Pairs:
    - Used for secure access to instances.
    - Users create key pairs, and the public key is used to encrypt login information.

6. Elastic IP:
    - A static public IP address that can be associated with an EC2 instance.
    - Helps in maintaining a consistent IP address for an instance even after stopping/restarting.

7. Auto Scaling:
    - Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on predefined conditions (e.g., traffic load, resource utilization) to maintain performance.

8. Load Balancing:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
